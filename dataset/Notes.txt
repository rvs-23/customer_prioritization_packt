1. Raw data contains the 6 datasets provided for analysis.

2. Final prepared base data contains the c and t tables 
merged and consolidated (this file isn't the final). It 
contains base_data_3m file which is obtained by merging
and consolidating all the 6 datasets. The dev_3m and ops_3m
files are two parts of the consolidated dataset for training 
and testing.

3. Final data processed contains the outlier removed
version (which is not the final dataset). The outlier 
removed dataset was resampled and we obtained base_data_resampled_tomek 
file. Resampling was also done for base_data_ops_3m file and is stored
here.

4. Evaluation folder contains the model_scores obtained after running
various experiments. It also contains the tuned Hyperparameters values
for Stochastic Gradient Descent.
