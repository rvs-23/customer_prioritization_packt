Contains the 4 modules for deployment.
1. The base_models contains all the different models
that were dumped to a pkl file. To test a model,
just copy and paste it to the same folder as the
models/unit test depending on which scripy
you are running. Otherwise, you will need to 
change the location in the code(not advisable).

2. Misc contains the final dataset used for training
and a unit test script that tests the chosen model
for randomly chosen 7 days.
